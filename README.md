- 👋 Hi, I’m @ExanderGuitar
- 👀 I’m interested in projects related with C++ and Swift. I would like to work in my spare time coding games or apps for iOS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advance concepts of C++ and next I will move to learn OpenGL to write amazing games.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C++ or Swift projects to understand how things are made by professionals and in community.
